# FizzBuzz IO
Doing the whole FizzBuzz kata thing again. This time in IO.

## Languages and Tools
```
	- IO
```

### To Open
Clone this repository.
```
  $ git clone git@github.com:barr-code/fizzbuzz_io.git
```

Change into the directory.
```
  $ cd fizzbuzz_io
```

### Other Languages
I have also coded Fizzbuzz in [Ruby](https://github.com/barr-code/fizzbuzz_ruby.git), [Javascript](https://github.com/barr-code/Javabuzz.git), and [Coffeescript](https://github.com/Scully87/Coffee_Buzz).

### Notes
This was a particularly interesting iteration of Fizzbuzz because I had to write my assertion methods myself in order
to test. That was fun and educational. IO is such a huge departure from Ruby, and I loved my brief but informative sojourn
into the prototypical language family.
